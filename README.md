# Google-Chrome-Sucks
My rant on why Google Chrome Sucks

If you stop it from updating, it will find a way to update itself.
Here's a workaround: http://updatefreezer.org/

I once lost all my bookmarks from this going from the v10 to v18 era. I restored from a backup that was about six months old, but it was still a big loss. These were WORK bookmarks!

Once you've tamed it's ability to update, it then constantly prompts you on many websites that flash is not up to date. On. Every. Single. Website. That. Uses. Flash. Flash is still used by approximately 10% of all websites. This metric comes from here and it's probably counting individual pages rather than the whole domain:

You can use these parameters but apparently they only work if you have the latest pepper flash dll:

--allow-outdated-plugins --ppapi-flash-version="19.0.0.226" --allow-outdated-plugins --ppapi-flash-path="C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\pepflashplayer32_19_0_0_226.dll"

Also using --allow-outdated-plugins alone does not work.

Other than that it works great, and on multiprocessor systems, it screams!

In summary and in conclusion (Tim Calhoun reference: http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/update-sen-tim-calhoun/n12210) Google Chrome SUCKS!
